       <p>Ready to head on one cool cave exploration? Here at the ice cream caves, everything is made of ice cream! We have every flavor you could think of, you just have to be willing to go find it! Some of our best flavors are the hardest ones to find! Donâ€™t worry though you can always ask our<b><span style="color:#808000"> Sixlets Swat Team</span></b> to help you find your way! If you want a more relaxed experience in our ice cream caves, you can take the walking path, that will offer our more traditional flavors of ice cream, and you will then end in our<b><span style="color:#DAA520"> Butterfinger Village</span></b>.
