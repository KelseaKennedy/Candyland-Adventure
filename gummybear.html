       <p>Hello and greetings from us on the Gummy Bear Patrol team. Here on the Patrol team we are mostly volunteers, but that doesn’t mean we don’t know a thing or two about the Mountain life. We will make sure you have the best time here on Candy Mountain. For the best time you can head over to our  <b><span style="color:#808000"> Lollipop Pool</span></b> and go for a swim with other locals. If you are wanting to let off some steam, or get extra cardio in for the day, you can head over to our<b><span style="color:#DAA520"> Sour Punch Gym</span></b>.
